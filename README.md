## How to Play Roulette
 If you are new to roulette, it is best to first learn the basics before trying out any strategies. Luckily, this is one of the easiest casino games and it only takes a few minutes to understand how to play roulette and master the game rules and mechanics.

 For starters, roulette is a game where players can bet on the outcome of a spin. The roulette wheel has 37 (or 38 for the American version) numbered pockets that range from 0 to 36. Every pocket also has a color, which is either black or red, with the exception 0 and 00, which are green.

 The game is played with a small white ball, which jumps on the roulette wheel while this spins around. As it slows down, the ball eventually lands in one of the pockets, thus determining the winning number for the round.

 In online roulette games, the outcome is determined by a random number generator (RNG). However, premium games will also keep the animation to recreate the authentic casino experience.

## Roulette Strategy Betting Options
 Roulette provides a wide range of betting options as players can group multiple numbers in the same bet. There are two categories for bets in roulette: inside bets and outside bets. Outside bets are generally the best when using a strategy.

### Inside Bets are:
 Straight – a bet placed on a single number by placing the chips in the center of a square.
 Split – a bet on two adjacent numbers, with the chips being placed on the common edge.
 Corner (Square) – a bet on four adjacent numbers that meet at the same corner, with the bet placed on the common corner.
 Street – a bet on three numbers located on a horizontal line on the table by placing the bet on the line at either end.
 Six Line (Double Street) – a bet on six numbers as part of two adjacent horizontal lines, with the chips being on the shared corner at either end.
### Outside Bets are:
 Low or High – a low bet covers 1-18, while a high bet is for 19-36; normally displayed in the corners of the table.
 Red or Black – a bet on the color of the pocket of the winning number, marked accordingly on the table.
 Even or Odd – a bet on the winning number being odd or even.
 Dozen Bet – a bet that covers 12 consecutive numbers, with three options available.
 Column Bet – a bet that covers an entire column with 12 numbers.

## How to Bet in Roulette
 Now that you know how the game works and what are the available bets, let’s quickly go over the actual playing process. We will be using a premium NetEnt European roulette game for this example, but the controls are similar in other versions as well.

 The first step is to select the size of the chips you want to use. The table betting limits are usually between $0.10 and $5,000, so there are plenty of chip denominations to choose from. Scroll left and right and click on the one you want to use.
